# Trihex-Research

This contains the Python code from Dr. Linda Green for the research on Polyhedra With Hexagonal and Triangular Faces and Three Faces Aronud Each Vertex.

The research aims to analyze polyhedra composed of hexagons and triangles with three faces around each vertex, and their 3-regular planar graphs of edges and vertices, which we call “trihexes”. Trihexes are analogous to fullerenes, which are 3-regular pla- nar graphs whose faces are all hexagons and pentagons. Every trihex can be represented as the quotient of a hexagonal tiling of the plane under a group of isometries generated by 180◦ rotations. Every trihex can also be described with either one or three “signatures”: triples of numbers that describe the arrange- ment of the rotocenters of these rotations. Simple arithmetic rules relate the three signatures that describe the same trihex. We obtain a bijection between trihexes and equivalence classes of signatures as defined by these rules. Labeling trihexes with signatures allows us to put bounds on the number of trihexes for a given number vertices v in terms of the prime factorization of v and to prove a conjecture concerning trihexes that have no “belts” of hexagons.

Specifically, the Python program used in this paper helps generate equivalent signatures for trihexes, and it also provides a graph that demonstrates the number of distinct trihexes with vertice v.
